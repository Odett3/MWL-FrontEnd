## 💖 Made with Love 💖

### Goal of the app: ✅✅

The idea behind the ❤️Made with Love❤️ app is to be able to sell your homemade food to users of the app. The app will have a geolocation where you can see who is posting near you, and prospective buyers can see where you are posting from.

Are you a great baker and have loads of free time on your hands? Share pictures and posts on Made with Love so you can sell your items to our users. 👩🏼‍🍳🧑🏽‍🍳👨🏻‍🍳

My aspiration is to make Homemade food trendy again.🍰🍪🍯

### Goal of the project: ✅✅

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack working app, practicing what we have learned in the bootcamp while exploring new technologies (I've listed all of these below) . I learned how to implement some features independently by doing research and watching tutorials on youtube.



* Build a full stak working app -> front end and back end 
* Have an initial working version after 2 weeks.** 
* Apply what we learned in Codaisseur's bootcamp
* Learn and implement new technologies/libraries
* Showcase and document development skills using:
  * wireframes as Minimum Viable Product
  * data models
  * user stories perspective
  * agile/kanban project approach
  * clear and frequent git commit mesages 

🍉 I am in the beginning of my coding adventure so any feedback or constructive critisism  you might have is highly appreciated! 

** (I will still be adding features in my free time and plan on "releasing" the mobile version of this app using 🍉 React Native🍉 very soon )


## 👩🏻‍🍳🍪 User Stories:

1. As a new user/ viewer of the site logged in or not I want to be able to see what kind of food listings are on offer.

2. I would like to be able to click on a listing of interest and see all the information; price, address, description of how it’s made and pictures.

3. As a new user, I want to be able to sign up and start sharing my food with my neighbours and browse what food is available.

4. As a user logged in, I would like to be able to click on the user’s picture and see more information about her/him.

5. As a new user, I would like to be able to add a new listing of the homemade food. I would like to be able to attach pictures to attract buyers and also add the location of where I am posting so prospective buyers can see where I am at
6. As a vegetarian user browsing the website, I want the listings to be tagged so I will only click on the listings that suit my needs. All listings should contain tags so it's easy to filter ex "vegan".

7. As a user wanting to browse through food listings and hopefully find something interesting, I would like to see what is around me - geolocation

8. As a user whether logged in or not I want to be able to encourage other users to post more so I want to be able to like a post.
